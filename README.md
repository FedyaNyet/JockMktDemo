# Jock MKT Demo

This application was developed using:
```
node --version v11.11.0
npm --version 6.7.0
```

Before getting started, install the appliction dependencies that are required to run the app.
Dependencies are installed into the `/node_modules` folder. In the project directory, run:

### `npm i`

## Available Scripts

You now have the option of running the following commands:

### `npm run demo`

The fastest way to view the application. This will build the app to the `\build` folder, then `serve` the static assets. 
Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the demo.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application bundle. The applicaiton bundle will be placed in the `/build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. 

### `npm run serve`

Starts a static server for the `/build` folder created by a previous `npm run build` command.
